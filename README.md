# OWL-Countdown
A Python program to show a countdown to the first weekend of Overwatch League e-sports games in Paris in 2020. This program will display the time remaining as a Windows 10 toast notification.
This program requires the win10toast library. (https://github.com/jithurjacob/Windows-10-Toast-Notifications)
Without the toast notification, this should work on other OS's.

The folder 'EXE' contains a easy-to-use executable.

Note that the icon file is not uploaded due to copyright reasons. The logo copyright belongs to it's respective owner(s).
Icon fixed by creating a .ico file named "owl.ico" in the same folder as the executable.
