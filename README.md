# OWL-Countdown
A Python program to show a countdown to the first weekend of Overwatch League e-sports games in Paris in 2020. This program will display the time remaining as a Windows 10 toast notification.
This program requires the win10toast library. (https://github.com/jithurjacob/Windows-10-Toast-Notifications)
Without the toast notification, this should work on other OS's.
